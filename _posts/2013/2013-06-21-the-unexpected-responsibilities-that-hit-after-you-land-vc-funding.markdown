The first year or two of a startup is so difficult that you'll cry yourself to sleep, wish (and feel) like dying, and wonder why on earth you're doing this. One of my co-founders reminded me of a scene in Pirates of Silicon Valley. Not sure how accurate this is, but to quote Woz, ["all of a sudden we're working harder than our fathers, who we laughed at for how hard they worked."](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=47ehNQIfHGs#t=32s)

And the whole time, you keep **almost** running out of cash - your lifeblood. When you come to think of it, if you just had *more* cash, *more* people, and *more* time... everything would be better, right. So obviously, when you close your first round, it's going to be easier...


Not so fast. At the end of the day, your job is still to build a machine that delivers enough value to someone, that they pay you money for it (and mor emoney than it cost you to deliver that value). Funding doesn't remove this responsibility. If anything, you trade a longer runway and more power against your competitors for increased responsibility to deliver on building that machine. Once you take the VC pill, you'll only be counted as an unquestionable success if you build a $100MM company (i.e. ~ $10MM in revenue) - or whatever equates to a 10x return. So when you go from just you, your cofounder(s), a few thousand bucks in the bank, and maybe some freind/family/fools money to 6 or 7 figures cash, a few things change drastically.

There are some things that remain the same. You're still going to wake up in the morning, just like the rest of the human race, cook, eat, and drink beer/wine - your personal life will feel almost identical. But **everything** about your company will change. So far, I can boil the changes for Ginkgotree down to three things: Board, Bills, and Business.

**1. Board**

Before you have outside investors, no one really gives a crap about what happenes to your startup. Your praents were proud of you - even though they can't relate to what you do. Your friend dynamic changes a bit because many will think of you as an ultra-important entrepreneur or something ridiculous that you simply are not, or may even grow jelous of you for whatever reason. But the fact of the matter is that no one really gave a whole, entire, complete crap about what came of your startup. It didn't affect anyone's job, ability to buy food, or pay the rent, and the most anyone had at stake was that maybe they would miss out on knowing someone who became well known. Your Board of directors are the first group of people who saw your company, the market you are disrupting, and had the experience and balls to put their LP's money where their mouth is. So you finally have someone outside yourself who is just as concerned about your startup's performance as you.

This changes things. It's not possible, nor is it right for your investors to know what is going on every single day, minute, and second. That's your job - and it's also your job to weigh all of those day-to-day fires, storms, and wins, and summarize them for your investors. They don't need hourly cat scans, but they do need a constant pager on your vitals. This will take more time than you think it does. Good VCs have come up with excellent hacks to streamline this - as I've found Detroit Venture Partners has. For DVP, this comes in the form of pop-in-meetings, Google Forms hacks, and quick, weekly meetings. If I need to let [Ted](http://tedserbinski.com/) know something (good or bad), or if I need help with something, he's all ears whenevr he's not in a meeting. Financial reportings take me 5 seconds, and that leaves quick weekly meetings to discuss the important stuff. Never-the-less, it's a real shock when it hits you that someone else cares just as much as you if your startup, your baby, your all in shot at changing the world, succeeds or fails.

**2. Bills**

As with anything, when the stakes are risen, the cost of doing business rises proportianally. Two years ago, eperiments for Ginkgotree cost nothing. I worked my network to get a phone call with someone, and I had a half hour chat. Then experiements cost a few hours of prep time to make screen shots that I could email... then they cost days/weeks of time to make dummy apps and website to hold conference calls and demos over. Fast forward a few more months, and the experiments started costing real money - because we started building a real product. After launching our product and getting yet more validation, Ginkgotree itself was one huge experiment that had made a lot of promises. Many eyes in the edtech world were watching (and still are). Then came the really big experiment: our first customer. **EVERYTHING** went into making sure the first 22 students that used Ginkgotree did so without a hitch. And then we magnified the size of that experiment by a few orders of magnitude and partnered with Blackboard - the largest non-publisher edtech corporation on the planet. The *only* way we could do that is if we closed funding. So somewhere along the way with singing with [Blackboard](http://www.blackboard.com), getting to know all the awesome people on theor Business Development team, we started to close. Which, as it always does, takes way longer than you expect.

With that, we're at a stage where experiments cost us five figures. Our current experiment is to test whether we can leverage the thouands of schools that count on Blackboard every year to sell Ginkgotree to the masses. As exciting as it is, it's very surreal to go from paying $1k bills to paying bills 10, 20, or more times that. **Especially** when paying those bills bleeds you of equity - as it should. If it didn't bleed you of something, the struggle to survivie, and evolve into something better than the last generation of products wouldn't be there
