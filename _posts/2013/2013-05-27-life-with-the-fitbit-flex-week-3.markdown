I've now been using the new Fitbit Flex for 3 weeks without interruption. It has replaced the default iOS alarm, and I've made checking my steps as regular as checking the time of day - honestly, I keep track of my steps more than the time now. Has it lived up to my expectations and requirements? I'm happy to say that the answer to that is **yes**. Let's break down the different aspects of the Fitbit Flex, one by one.

#### Step Tracking

I had a great opportunity to test the accuracy of the Flex's step tracking this weekend indirectly, by comparing it's computed distance with Google Maps while walking through Washington D.C. for a few days. Ove the course of two days, I walked about 18.5 miles through museums and buildings for meetings, and down sidewalks to get accross town. During the stretches accross town, the Flex was within about 5% agreement of Google Maps on all my trips - which for something the size of a large bean attached to my wrist is not bad! Of course, I didn't had a way of measuring accuracy against a GPS in buildings. In the coming months, I plan on keeping a log of the distances walked according to Google Maps and the Flex to measure a precise accuracy and standard deviation.

#### Fitbit Mobile App

A few weeks ago I ran into a guy at [the brewery](http://techbrewery.org) that was wearing **all three** activity trackers: The Jawbone Up, The Flex, and the Nike Fuel Band. Fitbit has all of them beat on mobile app design hands down. The app packs an enourmous amount of settings and features, yet still seems simple to operate. What really works well is adding food. It's not quite as good as [Lose It!](http://www.loseit.com/), but I can add pretty much any ingredient I can think of, and most food products. Another feature that has been a welcome addition to my daily return is the silent alarm. Given that Siri doesn't understand me half the time anyway, it's really not a big switch to use the Fitbit app. The vibrating wrist band wakes me every time, and if Lida doesn't want to get up at the same time, it won't wake her. In fact, I've found that I wake up more easily to a vibrating wrist than I do to an audible alarm.

#### Fitbit Web App

I spend most of my day on my computer, and quickly switching to another tab in Chrome is often more convenient than grabbing my iPhone, and fiddling with the tiny on-screen keyboard to enter food. The Flex comes with a tiny Bluetooth 4 dongle that I leave plugged into the back of my Thunderbolt display, which keeps my Fitbit account up-to-date throughout the day. The web app is well organized and easy to use - inputting food or a quick bike ride is a snap. It's also a breeze to check whether you are "in the goal zone." Fitbit's way of keeping a steady rate of food intake through the day, versus huge meals followed by hours of no caloric intake.

#### Summary

Overall, I'm very happy with the Flex. Lida didn't think she'd want one after trying it at CES, but she's been repeatedly asking me for my step count when we go on walks, wanting to keep tabs on our progress. I couldn't be any happier with the Flex. It's essentially exactly as described by Fitbit, and convenient enough that I stick with it!
