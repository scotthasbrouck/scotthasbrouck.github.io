One thing you'll end up doing a **lot** as a founder, is pitching your startup to a wide variety of people. Once you've chosen to depart from society's well worn path of Highschool &rarr; College &rarr; Career &rarr; Death, you no longer have an easy answer for "So, what do you do?" This is a good thing though. And the best part is that it just sort of organically happens. The fact is, explaining a complex system full of untested hypothesis over and over again to anyone from your grandmother to an investor will force you to understand your business better, and help you discover flawed assumptions.

It also really helps with momentum. The startup world is filled with fantastic people. People who want to see others create wealth, and improve themselves and  society. Even outside of the startup world, you'll find fantastic sources of encouragement - which you **will need a lot of**!

However, you need to be warned of the "experienced" nay-sayers. Initially, they seem to ask fantastic questions, like "Who is your customer?," or "How can you scale X if Y happens?" So you'll begin wondering if they're an investor, or a current or former entrepreneur... But soon, you'll notice a trend. You realize you're not in a discussion, but an interrogation. You'll begin to feel doubt and defenssiveness billowing up in your gut, as you're tempted to slowly turn your responses from insightful, researched, and humble to incomplete and off-the-cuff.

**BAM!** You've been cornered by an "experienced" nay-sayer, armed with a heat seeking laser for your faults.

These individuals initially have similar traits, questions, and behaiviors as the bounty of awesome founders and hackers that make the startup world go-round, but there is one drastic difference that can be easily recognized: **their first goal is to find your failures, and not your successes**. Every one of your successes has a story of failures (ideally fast failures) that were *required* before you were able to truly understand what everyone else that gave your market/product a shot did not understand. And every good investor or founder knows that the failures you've already had are just the begining. The trait about a founder that pushes the needle forward is that they have the insight, balls, and persistance to be right slighlty more than they are wrong. Because, when you play that persistence out over the life of a business, the 52.68% success rate will compound!

###How to identify a nay-sayer

Every pitch involves an inquiring party, and a revealing party. But every **good** pitch is more of a discussion, not a one-sided presentation. Secondly, questions from the inquiring party should be seeking depth about your successes. Whether it is a partner, investor, co-founder, or customer, the inquiring party is seeking some reason to believe that you're the real deal, and that you've moved the needle, gained traction, truly understand a problem, and can execute. Here's a good rule of thumb to watch out from the inquirer:
> Every initial question should be followed up by **at least 2 more related questions** that seek depth and better undersatnding

A nay-sayer will quickly jump from topic to topic if you satisfy their inquiry... until they find a weakness. Then they'll dive in relentlessly until you begin feeling that doubt and defenssiveness billowing inside. This leads me to a good rule of thumb to watch for in *yourself*:
> You start turning the pitch from a **discussion to a deffensive lecture**

Assuming you typically pitch with a discussion and not a lecture (how it should be), this is the first first sign you've let things go too far. This just happened to me earlier this week, when I caught myself defending that our team has someone with the chops for institutional sales. I found myself actually *defending* our traction! Think about that: traction is data, and it should speak for itself. Instead I found myself reitterating that we managed to sell a major state university while still bootstrapped, and that we had done this, and that... and this other thing with another school. I let myself get sucked into the black hole.

###Diffusing nay-sayers

Thankfully, I realized what had happened - even if it was pretty late into the conversation. I decided once and for all, this is the last time I was going to let myself get sucked into a situation like this for so long (about half an hour). So here's what I did to diffuse the conversation and step away:

1. Someone offering you business advice upon first meeting should be able to justify themselves with *real* experience. The moment a critique is made, **ask them for justification with real experience/insight into an industry**. This past week's run-in, the guy didn't have any real startup experience, and was a "big fan" of Steve Blank at the moment. Hhmmm... yep. *That* makes sense.

2.  From this, it's pretty easy to ask them **what they've done for other startups and what their ask is**. Most often, they're looking for an advisory or coaching role. If they *are* looking for some sort of role, ask them what they've done to move the needle for other startups.

Why worry about this? Why not just walk away to spend your time networking with others? Respect, and the fact that the startup world is very small.

###Why is this important? Am I just *ranting*?

As a founder, I've found this to be a real problem for me. I've spent hours upon hours needlessly arguing in conversations at import networking events, wasting both my time, and the time of the person who first approached me. Considering [Ginkgotree](http://www.ginkgotree.com/) is an enterprise B2B product sold to institutions, networking at events is how we moved sales our first few months and snagged pivotal partnerships. Every moment spent at an important event is an opportunity to get your product in the hands of users, find strategic partners, or get priceless feedback that can net you insights to push the needle past your competitors. So get out there, and use my mistakes to **increase your SNR when networking**!
